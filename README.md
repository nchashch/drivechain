# Drivechain
This is a library for building
[BIP300](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0300.mediawiki "BIP300
two way peg
proposal")/[BIP301](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0301.mediawiki
"BIP301 blind merged mining proposal") sidechains. There are FFI bindings for
[C++](https://github.com/nchashch/drivechain-cpp "C++ FFI Bindings") and
[C](https://github.com/nchashch/drivechain-cpp "C FFI Bindings").

So far two sidechains were built using this library:

- [zcash sidechain](https://github.com/nchashch/zcash-sidechain "zcash sidechain built with the library") (using C++ FFI bindings)
- [ethereum sidechain](https://github.com/nchashch/ethereum-sidechain "ethereum sidechain built with the library") (using cgo and C FFI bindings)
